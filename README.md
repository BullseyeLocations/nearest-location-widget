# nearest-location-widget
A small JavaScript widget using the Bullseye API to display the nearest location to a user.

This widget can be embedded onto any web page to display location information to a user using the Bullseye Locations API. An example could include a small banner which gets the user's location and performs a search via the Bullseye API to return a retail location close by to the user with store name, location and phone number. The banner could be displayed at the top of your website to provide easy access to the user. The widget is highly customizable using JavaScript and CSS. A basic example is provided which can be implemented with just a few modifications to some of the variables such as your Bullseye ID and API key.

Further instructions on implementation can be found on our blog: http://www.bullseyelocations.com/blog/nearest-location-widget
